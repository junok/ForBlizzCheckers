Dear Blizzard recruiter,

Thank you for this opportunity to show what I what I can do for Blizzard.
Although this was a test, I had a surprising amount of fun with it and 
am proud of what I've accomplished and I hope it meets to your standards.
All the files I think you'd like to see were put in the "For_Blizzard" directory, but the rest of the 
project is included.
It took me around 3.5 hours on February 4th from 6:30PM to 10:10PM of coding to make a final playable build
and used the rest of the 4 hours to add clearer instructions and to clean up code.
I took extra time out of the 4 hours just for commenting, and I hope that was not a violation
of the rules.

Currently it's a single player game of Checkers where you play as O's, but I want to improve 
upon this game with adding extra features later.  Some of the features I've thought of that
could be implemented within a couple hours include:
	
	- Multiplayer Mode
	- Dynamaic Board sizing
	- Unity game build

I will continue to work to implement these features just for my own sake of completing my project,
but since it would have been outside of the 4 hours I was given I have decided to just go with one
stable build of checkers with all its core features.

I look forward to hearing from Blizzard soon and I hope you'll have as much fun playing as I 
did making it and would love to hear feedback on what you think I did well and what I could improve on.
I wish you luck!  Thank you!
